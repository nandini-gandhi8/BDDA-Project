Project 1- Mobile Price Classification<br>
#This project represents the sales data of mobile phones from various competitor brands<br>
#In this dataset, we are going to estimate price of mobiles for a new company by considering competitive mobile phone market<br>
#Data visualization has been carried to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price.<br>

Project 2- New York City Taxi Fare Prediction<br>
#We are predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations.<br>
While we will get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used (see the starter code for an example of this approach in Kernels).
